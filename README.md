# fibonacci
A recreation of the Fibonacci sequence. This is a pure academic exercise from discrete mathematics and sequences. Write a function or method that given an integer will determine if the integer is part of the Fibonacci Sequence and if it is, on the output, print the two integers that preceeds the integer that was passed as an argument to the function or method.
